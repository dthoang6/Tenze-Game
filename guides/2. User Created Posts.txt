71. Letting user created posts: 01/30/23
- post controller and post model
- what do we want to happen if a logged in user clicks on create post button?
- we want to take them to a new url that renders a new html template.

.using html template for create-post.ejs
.adjust create post button to point towards a specific route 
/create-post in home-dashboard.ejs
.setup a route for this matching url within our router file and calling function:  postController.viewCreateScreen.
.setup a postController and start exporting function that the router can call.

exports.viewCreateScreen = function (req, res) {
  res.render("create-post");
};

.before we move any further, we want to make sure that you can only visit this route if you're logged in.
.if you're not logged in and you visit this create-post url, you should be redirect to the home page with a red flag error message.
.It means we restrict a route so that only logged in users can access it by creating a reusable function: 
userController.mustBeLoggedIn and call it in router for restrict url.

---
-create-post.ejs is a new template with hard fake code, so we need to adjust and update the gravatar image, logout button.
-we need to pass into create-post.ejs a relevant session data to power the unique gravatar.

exports.viewCreateScreen = function (req, res) {
  res.render("create-post", 
  { username: req.session.user.username, avatar: req.session.user.avatar });
};

.when we render a create-post.ejs, we give it a second argument to send it an object which is a data that gets passed into the template.
.instead of making an update to each header of each template, we going to create one single reusable template file for header.
.views/includes/header.ejs
.header.ejs, copy the header of home-dashboard to this header.ejs
.then include the header.ejs to home-dashboard.ejs. create-post.ejs to remove the duplication code.

<%- include("includes/header") %>
---------------------
-72. remove the duplication code when we pass session data into the current template that we want to render.

.get rid of this in userController, and postController

{ username: req.session.user.username, avatar: req.session.user.avatar }

.in app.js, telling express to run the function for every request so that we have access to a "user property" from within any of our ejs templates by: <% user.  %>

-----set thing up so that our guest homepage template also pulls in our shared header.ejs

.copy logging form from home-guest.ejs and delete the header code
.using if else to set up header.ejs if user login or not
.include header in home-guest.ejs

-----set up reusable file for our footer so our templates will not have any duplicated code.
-------------------

73. Post Model: Saving a post into database

.be aware of where this create-post form is submitting to.
.when the form is submit, it is a post request
.when the create post button click, it is a get request
- postController.create function

.create a Post.js model to manage the data
.if a post was successful created, when call create function. the create function will return a promise with resolve and we want to redirect the user to the new url for that post and flash a message.

.if the post was not created, then create function will return a promise with rejects which is a array of errors.

Post.prototype.cleanUp = function () {};

Post.prototype.validate = function () {};

Post.prototype.create = function () {};

------------missing the author of post
- we want to keep track of which user account created which posts documents.
- we would want another field named author, but we would not want to set its value to the user name because in most applications, users can change their username.
- mongodb document has a unique ID value

-using session data
.whenever user login or register we're going to store avatar, username, id of user in the user current session data.
.within our postController we pass the session data we save from userController, when we using Post model to create post so the Post will receive the id data.

75. Viewing a Post: 01/31/23
- work on the ability to view a post within our Web App instead of just this private mongodb database screen
- we want each post has its unique url

.how can we view that existing post from within our website, from within url for that post?
.start with single-post-screen.ejs template with hard fake code
.imagine: localhost:3000/post/abc
.using router to set up url for post and calling viewSingle function for this incoming url request

.setup the last part of post url to the id of the post with: viewSingle, and findSingleById function.
.we are not trying to create a new instance of a post (object oriented approach) instead we calling a function by adding a property as a function into the Post Model.

.working with single-post-screen.ejs for dynamic data to pull in real data
  post.title
  post.createdDate
  post.body
  .author: pull in the author of the post is a bit more challenging because we need the author's username but We only store the ID of the user account.
    .from post document we have an author id, using this id to look up for matching user document for username, email, gravatar.
    .it means we perform the look up in next step
    .the aggregate operations are not actually manipulating any data in the database.
    .It's simply returning data that we can use however we want.
    .We want to use this data within our controller and passing it to an html template.
----------------------------------
77.78. Performing a Lookup in mongodb
- setup 404 template
- pulling in the author username, email, gravatar with Post.findSingleById
- clean up the posts array to return only author username and avatar

- we get avatar by update User Object to have getAvatar argument, so if the getAvatar is true, call getAvatar function.

---------------------------------
79. User profile screen 02/01/23
- when user click on profile photo to visit profile.ejs

.create template profile.ejs
.setup profile related routes
.create 2 functions in userController: 
  .ifUserExists: call findByUsername to find request username and handle the return Promise.
  .profilePostsScreen.
.create function in User Model: findByUsername.
  .check the username
  .perform findOne database operation and handle the return Promise with then and catch.

.pull in real data from profileUser after calling findByUsername if user exist from controller to template profile.ejs.

80. View posts by author
- load in the post by author in profile.ejs

.In userController starting with exports.userController.profilePostsScreen
  .using Post to call findByAuthorId and handle the return Promise from this function.
  .create function Post.findByAuthorId in Post Model.
  .pull in real data for posts in Profile.ejs

--------------------------------
81. Is the current visitor the owner of the post? 02/02/23
- setup when click profile in header.ejs to redirect to profile.ejs with href="/profile/:<%= user.username %>"

- adjust things so that only the author of post would see the edit and delete button.
  .app.js: setup a piece of code that will run at the start every request and it will check to see if the current visitor has a user object in session data.
  .If they do, visitorID = user id.
  .If they don't, visitorID = 0
  .pass the req.visitorID input into controller, post, and function.

  .add new property isVisitorOwner into post in reusablePostQuery function
  .wrap an edit and delete button into an if statement.

- in mongodb, if you include a dollar sign within quotes, it knows that you're talking about that actual field not a literal string of text.

- when owner click edit button, take them to edit screen url.

82. The "Edit" Screen for a post 02/03/23
- take user to url: href = "post/<%= post.id %>/edit" if author click edit and render a post for user to edit

83. Updating posts in database using post request
- working on what should happen when this edit-post form is submitted

exports.edit = function(req, res) {
  let post = new Post(req.body, req.visitorId, req.params.id)
  post.update().then().catch()
}

Post.update() function to return a Promise

.before we worry about update, we should make sure that the post id is exist or valid id

.who is the author of post using function findSingleById to return the object with property isVisitorOwner, if it is, actually update the post into database and resolve, else reject it.

- We want to potentially leverage flash message in almost every template.
- Instead of passing errors message using export.home make it available from app.js to all template
-


85. Miscellaneous improvements 02/06/23
- setup so that if you're not the owner of the post, you can't see the edit form screen.
- setup feature: within our edit post form screen, towards the top there will be a link that said back to view post or back to permalink for this post. So when you're done editing a post and you want to view it again, you don't need to rely on your web browsers history or web browser back button.

-user Bootstrap library for visual styling in the app.

- set up a protect of edit screen url and the post route where you would actually submit the form.
- the idea here is that if a visitor doesn't have a user object in session data, meaning they're not logged in.


86. Markdown: safe user generated html 02/06/23
- ejs escaping user generated content for security reasons.
- Otherwise, we will be 100% vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.
- how can we prevent malicious code while also allowing innocent things like paragraph, bold text? using package marked.

.leverage mark in app.js

- if a user is able to actually execute JS from the front end of your app, It's game over.
- user can inject js into the frontend to program the web browser to send off an asynchronous http request to the server, on the behalf of other user browser, and allow the malicious user to do whatever they want on your behalf.

- using package sanitize-html to cleanup user post for security reason and support markdown.
- learn more about markdown cheatsheet githup


88. Let users delete a post
exports.delete
Post.delete

findSingleById
